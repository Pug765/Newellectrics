<h1>Our embedded system</h1>
<p1>Our embedded system is a light sensitive system, When the brightness levels drop below a certain point, a light turns on. </p>
<h2>How we made this</h2>
<p2>We made this embedded system by connecting a microbit to a laptop and connecting it to a breadboard.
	<img src="Screenshot.jpg" alt="Screenshot code">
	<p3> We then connected 1 jumper cable from the 30 on the blue line to OV.
Connected 1 jumper cable from the 25 on the red line to 3V.
Connected resistor from 18 blue to 12 g
And connected last  jumper cable </p3>

<h3>Price</h3>
<p4>The price of this light sensitive embedded system is 25$, this is because it costs a significant amount to build this system and our team need to make a profit, i hope these are fair. Any questions please email them to @Newellectrics.ie or contact us by phoning +353749253.
